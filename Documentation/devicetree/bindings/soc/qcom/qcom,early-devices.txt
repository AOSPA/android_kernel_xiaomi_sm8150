* early-devices

Some initcall stage takes long time to finish and it's better we launch some
of our userspace applications earlier before these initcalls. This way, the
userspace applications we care after system booting can start to work earlier
and provide better user experience.
To achieve this, we need to populate and probe some platform devices earlier
(thus its name early-devices) since these devices are commonly needed by all
other subsystems. Usually this list of devices includes clock, regulator,
bus components, iommu, crypto device, etc. and it's soc related(depends on
how these devices are connected in hardware in specific soc).

Required properties:
- compatible:
	Usage: required for early-devices
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "qcom,early-devices"
- devices:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle array>
	Definition: nodes handle for early devices.

Example:
	early-devices {
		compatible = "qcom,early-devices";
		devices = <&ufs_phy_gdsc &clock_rpmh &clock_gcc
			&ad_hoc_bus &ufs_ice &ufsphy_mem
			&ufshc_mem &apps_rsc &cmd_db
			&ldoa10 &ldoc5 &ldoc8
			&smpa4 &tlmm &ldoa5
			&cxlvl &mxlvl &bps_gdsc
			&ipe_0_gdsc &ipe_1_gdsc &ife_0_gdsc
			&ife_1_gdsc &titan_top_gdsc &mvsc_gdsc
			&mvs0_gdsc &mvs1_gdsc>;
	};
